This project uses AI technology to extract the core content of the article, including author introduction, writing background, main content, and classic quotes. Whether you are reading a book or not, it can help you understand the book in depth.

Based on the classic scenes in the book, AI is used to add exquisite illustrations to increase the interest of reading.

In addition, text analysis technology is used to create a word cloud of articles to help you fully understand a book.

It helps develop vocabulary, improve memory, and enhance attention span. These skills are not only essential for academic success but also valuable in everyday life.
